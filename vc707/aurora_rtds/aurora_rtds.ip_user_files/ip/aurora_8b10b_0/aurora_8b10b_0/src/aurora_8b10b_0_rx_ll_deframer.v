//  RX_LL_DEFRAMER
//
//
//  Description: the RX_LL_DEFRAMER extracts framing information from incoming channel
//               data beats. It detects the start and end of frames, invalidates data
//               that is outside of a frame, and generates signals that go to the Output
//               and Storage blocks to indicate when the end of a frame has been detected.
//
//               This module supports 2 4-byte lane designs
//
