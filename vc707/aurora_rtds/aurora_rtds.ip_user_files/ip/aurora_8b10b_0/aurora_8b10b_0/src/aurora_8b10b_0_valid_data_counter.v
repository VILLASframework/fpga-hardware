//  VALID_DATA_COUNTER
//
//
//  Description: the VALID_DATA_COUNTER module counts the of lanes in the channel
//               containing valid data. The module is presented with a register
//               representing the lanes that were valid on the previous clock cycle.
//               Each 2-byte lane in the channel is represented by a single bit:
//               when the bit is high the corresponding lane holds valid data. The
//               COUNT output indicated the total number of lanes found with valid
//               data bits.
//
//
//               This module supports 2 4-byte lane designs
//             
//
